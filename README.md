# ADA/Cardano Active Stake Scout

This simple, autonomous bot will watch the Active Stake of any pool for you
in an effort of preventing yourself from staking your ADA in a pool that
ends up getting over 64 million ADA actively staking.

This way, you do not have to worry about the number of ADA being staked in
your pool, as this nifty, little bot can and will text you (or even call
you) periodically with an update.

*This app uses a BeatifulSoup-based webscraper to scrape data from adapools.org* 

## Steps for Success!
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you're going to want these dependencies.
2. Activate a Twilio account (for free) and insert the details into secrets.py
3. Write your staking pool into `ada_pool.txt`
4. `python3 main.py` and away you go!

Note:  This app is currently set to notify you every day at around 8am and 8pm.
